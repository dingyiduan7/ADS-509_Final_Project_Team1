Dogecoin has a long history with mental health support and awareness. Recently @wilw wrote a blog post about his journey relating. https://t.co/i1JM64sEtW We share this in hopes that it might help anyone who is also struggling. ‚ù§Ô∏è You are never alone, please , do not give up.
Platforms and exchanges are not banks. The space has little accountability still and near to no recourse if something happens with your funds. Be mindful of the services you are using and places you engage your funds with. Moon for everyone but we have to be smart! ‚ù§Ô∏è #Dogecoin
A reminder to be careful shibes! Dogecoin is not forking to Ethereum and does not have a hardfork coming up. Please be careful and remember if we are doing something, you will hear from us; not a random company or person asking you for funds. #dogecoin Please be safe!
Please make sure you have back ups of all the data you need to access your funds. Look at where you are handling them externally; if that service/platform/bot went down, would the loss of access bother you? If yes, move them some place only you control. Stay safe shibes #dogecoin

Timely reminder that no giveaway should ever need you to send them money, that would be insane. Don't send money to people who tell you they'll give you more back.
Please remember this is an alpha release though, you should be comfortable compiling it, and should wait for at least the beta if not.
