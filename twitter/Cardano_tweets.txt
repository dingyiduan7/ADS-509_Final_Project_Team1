Try your hand at writing Marlowe contracts on the @InputOutputHK Playground. 

You can even use Blockly, write in Haskell or Javascript: https://t.co/wlNw6MAbpK 

#Cardano #SmartContracts #DeFi #Blockchain"
"Q: How will lending work?

A: Cardano has a native token, but supports multiple other tokens - it can be done in any of those. 

#Cardano #Marlowe #DeFi #CryptoLending"
"Q: What is the Marlowe suite of products? 🤔

A: High level, 3 prongs: 
1) Developers (Marlowe Playground; for testing)
2) End users (Marlowe Run; Smart Contract Templates)
3) Enterprise (Stay tuned)

#Cardano #Marlowe #SmartContracts"
"Q: Are Smart Contracts just for Finance?

A: No, they are also incredibly useful in the Legal environment and will significantly reduce the cost and time taken to process a contract.

#Cardano #SmartContracts #Marlowe https://t.co/i19p1dretu"

Stability
- Core functions of money
- Stablecoins (useful for lending, credit)

Costs
- (Currently) Quite high when networks are congested
- (Currently) Vary heavily over time
- Insurance services

"What is the Future of DeFi?

Product:
- Modularity
- Composability

Interoperability:
- Asset transfer across chains, bridges, lending, Omnichain DEX
– Deep Interoperability; cross-chain contracts, standardisation (noticing a pattern?)

#Cardano #SmartContracts #Marlowe https://t.co/W8sMw6HYgM"
"What is the Future of DeFi?

To be successful, users need to be able to understand a smart contract.. more on that later.
